# Diagnostic Logger for WordPress

A must-use (MU) plugin for advanced diagnostics of WordPress page loads. It logs SQL queries, HTTP API calls, browser-side network activity, and server-side metrics ‚Äî all tied together by a unique page request ID.

---

## üöÄ Why Use This Plugin?

This tool is built to help you:

- Debug performance issues
- Trace unexpected API requests
- Identify heavy or repeated SQL queries
- Monitor what happens during every WordPress page load

---

## üîç What It Captures

- SQL queries (with count and total execution time)
- WordPress HTTP API requests (`wp_remote_get()`, etc.)
- JavaScript-initiated `fetch()` and `XMLHttpRequest` calls
- Page execution time (PHP runtime)
- CPU and memory usage (via `ps`, if supported)
- Request count per page view (tracked via PHP session)
- All data grouped by a unique `DIAG_PAGE_ID` cookie

---

## üìÅ Installation Instructions

1. Copy the plugin file into your WordPress MU plugin directory:

   `wp-content/mu-plugins/diagnostic-logger.php`

2. Open the plugin file and find the line that checks your IP address.

   Replace `'YOUR_IP_HERE'` with your actual IP address to ensure diagnostics only run when you're accessing the site.

3. Ensure the following directory exists and is writable:

   `wp-content/logs/`

   If it doesn't exist, the plugin will attempt to create it automatically.

## üß™ How to Confirm It's Working

After installing:

- Visit any page on your site
- Then check these files inside `wp-content/logs/`:
  - `test.log` ‚Äî confirms the plugin loaded
  - `ip-diagnostic.log` ‚Äî main log for SQL, API calls, and server metrics
  - `browser-requests.log` ‚Äî logs browser-side activity like `fetch()` and AJAX

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Usage Notes

- This plugin forces:
  - `WP_DEBUG = true`
  - `WP_DEBUG_LOG = true`
  - `SAVEQUERIES = true`

- It is **not intended for long-term or production use**.  
  Logs will grow quickly and the overhead may impact performance.

## üßπ When You're Done

Once you've completed diagnostics:

- Delete the plugin from the `mu-plugins/` directory
- Remove the `wp-content/logs/` directory if no longer needed
